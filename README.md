# Tasks via Dialogue in Different Service Scenarios

There is a large amount of task-oriented dialogue corpus created to solve specific tasks in different domains and scenarios. Here I collected some of them, which may cover most popular benchmarks for research. Such that we compare and utilize dialogue corpus to complete feasible tasks.

### Task 1 The Delivery/Purchase Order Automation Task 

The ultimate goal for delivery/purchase order automation via dialogue is to generate a structured order (i.e. JSON format) by mining from dialogue context and assigning semantic roles to different entities mentioned in the dialogue. Based on dialogue history and current action, the system is required to fill and update slots within the order frame. Which means, name entity recognition, especially on address and time, and slot filling are of importance in delivery order automation task.
